Plans
 * Clean up the nomenclature around nodes, instances, processes etc. Currently there are
   several confusing parts where a single noun means different things in different places.
 * Clean up address handling.
  - Introduce the concept of views that are primarily constructed by spawn_scatter.
  - Views should be easily constructible from scratch by providing a list of URIs.
  - Use a fungible URI class that contains both resource identifier and address.
 * Add more robust worker management to cluster. Instances should be able to:
  - Monitor the worker OS process
  - Force terminate the process in case it doesn't respond
  - etc...
